<p>I love shows like Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, CSI, Criminal Minds, the list goes on and onnnn. They are my guilty pleasure/comfort shows and I could watch them for hours. </p>
<h2>COFFEE + COFFEE + more COFFEE</h2>

<p>I live and breathe coffee= hot coffee, iced coffee, lattes, frappes, you name it, I'll drink it. Back on campus, you could find me at the 35th and State Starbucks constantly between classes, now, you can find me at my local Dunkin!</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>

<p>Lastly, you have your classic sleeping hobby. YES, it's a real hobby trust me. I make time for my slumber and I make sure that I prioritize it, without it I am nothing. </p>
